# ABAP to Confluent Kafka REST Proxy Connector

Welcome to the ABAP to Kafka REST Proxy Connector.

This connector produces and consumes ABAP data to and from Kafka via the [Confluent Rest Proxy](https://docs.confluent.io/current/kafka-rest/docs/index.html). It implements a subset of the [v2 API](https://docs.confluent.io/current/kafka-rest/docs/api.html#api-v2).

This connector is intended to be run on SAP NetWeaver ABAP Systems. It has so far only been tested in SAP ABAP 7.5x, but most of it should be fine from ABAP 7.3x onwards. 

## How to install

You need to have [abapGit](https://github.com/larshp/abapGit) installed in your system. Once you have abapGit correctly set-up, just clone it into the system following abapGit instructions.
